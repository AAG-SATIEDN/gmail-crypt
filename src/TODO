Signing Key when encrypting

Add the ability to create keys within the extension

Key ID values are calculated based on a hash of the public key information. Without the public key how do we know the ID of a key ?(see RFC 4880 12.2)
    Possible solution: Assume that the signer of a private key is using the ID for that key.  I think this might break the OpenPGP
    Possible solution: Correlate Public Keys with Private Keys
    Possible solution: Do not use key id in decryption
