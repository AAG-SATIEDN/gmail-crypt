Figure out why the encrypt option isn't always populating. It seems like the DOMSubtreeModified event is not firing if in your gmail window you have already composed one email.

Make Drafts stop uploading to gmail.
    Do I overload/intercept functions from being loaded, or do I intercept XHR requests?

Signing Key when encrypting

Add the ability to create keys within the extension

For private key insertion: Key ID values are calculated based on a hash of the public key information. Without the public key how do we know the ID of a key ?(see RFC 4880 12.2)
    Possible solution: Assume that the signer of a private key is using the ID for that key.  I think this might break the OpenPGP
    Possible solution: Correlate Public Keys with Private Keys
    Possible solution: Do not use key id in decryption
